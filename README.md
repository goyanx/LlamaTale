<p align="center"> Welcome to LlamaTale! </p>

This is a fork of the discontinued IF/MUD framework Tale. It uses an LLM backend to describe things in a more vivid way. (LLM not included)

The goal is to merge the structure of MU* frameworks with the creative and generative abilities of LLM's for the ultimate immersive roleplaying experience.

There's a discord server. Go there to get help and discuss LlamaTale: https://discord.gg/8SCKjEbU

Check the wiki for some instructions: https://github.com/neph1/LlamaTale/wiki 

I try to test before each release, but I'm just one developer. If something doesn't work, please raise an Issue, and I'll try to fix it ASAP.


Features (See https://github.com/neph1/LlamaTale/releases for a more up to date list):
* When the MUD describes something, through commands like 'look' or other verbs, it sends the original description as a prompt to the LLM which (hopefully) generates a more vivid and verbose one.
* Dialogue replies generated by LLM, based on story, characters, sentiment.
* Since https://github.com/neph1/LlamaTale/releases/tag/v0.13.0, it can generate a wholly custom story based on prompts. 
* Combat is decided by the MUD, then acted out by the LLM.
* Characters have a memories of past events and conversations, as well as a flexible 'sentiment' towards other characters.
* Locations outside (south of) The Prancing Llama are entirely generated by the LLM.
* Support for KoboldCpp and OpenAI API based backends.


Old Example:

Here's the kind of output you can expect. "Original" is the written description. "Generated" is what the LLM produces.

Scenario background story: After a grizzling journey through the snow storm you have finally
  arrived at  The Prancing Llama, the only refuge for miles and miles in
  this craggy, snow-covered landscape.  You have heard many tales about
  this place, but now the time has come to make your own.
  
>  Original:[ [’[Entrance]’, ’A room full of furry and snow-covered
  coats.  Loud voices and roars of laughter can be heard from the main
  hall.’, “There’s a warm glow and loud, noisy conversations coming
  through a doorway to the north “] ] Generated: As I entered the
  building, I was greeted by a sea of fluffy and snow-dusted jackets,
  their colors and patterns as varied as the people wearing them.  The
  air was alive with excited chatter and boisterous laughter, echoing
  off the walls like a symphony of joy.  To my left, a door stood open,
  revealing a room ablaze in light and sound - voices mingling together
  in a cacophony of warmth and camaraderie.

> Original:[ [’[Main Hall]’, ’An area full of tables with people eating,
  drinking and talking’, ’  To the west you see a giant hearth with a
  comforting fire’, ’A fierce looking woman sitting by a table, whose
  eyes seem to follow you.  A slender gentleman with a patch over one of
  his eyes, leaning against the wall.’] ] Generated: As I entered the
  building, my gaze was immediately drawn to the bustling main hall,
  where tables were scattered throughout the room like islands in a sea
  of chatter and laughter.  The air was thick with the scent of
  delicious food and warmth, and my stomach rumbled in anticipation.  By
  the west wall, a massive hearth roared with life, its flames casting
  flickering shadows across the room as they danced on the walls.  In
  one corner, a fierce-looking woman sat at her table, her eyes
  constantly moving as she surveyed the scene around her.  Next to her,
  a slender gentleman with a patch over one eye leaned against the wall,
  his gaze fixed on something beyond my line of sight.I couldn’t
  help but feel a sense of excitement as I made my way towards them,
  eager to join in the merriment and warmth that filled the room.


Excerpt from talking to Elid:

 
  You say: elid: ’what are you doing here?’.

>   Elid Gald says: “Elid Gald chuckles mischievously at Arto’s question
  and smirks, adjusting his hat before responding, “Why, I’m just
  enjoying a stroll through the market, my dear sir.  And what about
  yourself?  What brings you to these parts?”  His voice is smooth and
  alluring with an undercurrent of danger hidden beneath it.”

  You say: elid: ’i’m looking for some goods to buy, my purse is laden
  with gold’.

>   Elid Gald says: “Elid Gald nods approvingly at Arto’s mention of
  wealth and grins wickedly, leaning in closer to whisper, “Well then,
  perhaps I can help you find something truly unique and valuable.
  Perhaps some items that are not available on the open market, eh?  You
  see, I have connections with certain…merchants who might be willing
  to part with their finest wares for someone like you.”  He pauses
  meaningfully, allowing the implication to linger in the air between
  them as his hand slips casually into his pocket.As he speaks, one
  could almost hear the clinking of coins in his pocket - but whether
  it’s real or just a clever illusion is anyone’s guess.  “You know,” he
  says softly, “I’ve always been known for my eye for rare and exquisite
  goods.  Why not let me help you acquire something truly special?
  After all, I’m sure you don’t want to be caught with common trinkets.”
  His voice is silky smooth and seductive as he leans even closer to
  Arto, a glint of mischief in his remaining eye.”Wouldn’t you
  rather have something that sets you apart from others?  Something that
  screams ’wealthy aristocrat’?””

You say: elid: ’maybe you’re right.. do you charge a fee for your
  services?’.

>   Elid Gald says: “Elid Gald chuckles softly and takes a step back,
  giving Arto an appraising look.  “I always charge a fee, young man,”
  he says with a smirk, “And my fee is quite substantial.  But I believe
  that the items I can help you acquire will be more than worth it.”
  His voice is still silky smooth and seductive, his mischievous gaze
  never leaving Arto’s face.\n”However,” He continues, “If you’re
  willing to make a deal with me… let’s say, a mutually beneficial
  agreement… then we could discuss a different kind of payment.”  He
  winks at Arto, his remaining eye gleaming with curiosity.”What do
  you think?  Are you willing to take a risk for something truly
  unique?””
